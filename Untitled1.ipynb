    "Tuples are ordered collections of elements, similar to lists. However, they have several characteristics that distinguish them:\n",

    "Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. The order of elements in a tuple is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: Elements in a tuple can be accessed using indices. Indexing starts from 0, similar to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, other tuples, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: One of the key characteristics of tuples is that they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed. However, if an element is mutable (such as a list), it can be modified within the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, provided that all the elements inside the tuple are also hashable.\n",

    "To answer your question directly: Yes, tuples are immutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements. However, if an element of the tuple is mutable (like a list), you can modify that mutable object within the tuple, but you cannot reassign the element itself or change the size of the tuple."
